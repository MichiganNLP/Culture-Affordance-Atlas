Culture Affordance Atlas is a curated dataset and knowledge base derived from Dollar Street that highlights how communities around the world solve everyday needs like cooking, sleeping, bathing, and more, using objects shaped by culture, geography, and income. 

Explore how function-based representations can foster more inclusive AI systems, improve model generalization, and surface underrepresented knowledge from low-income and non-Western contexts.
